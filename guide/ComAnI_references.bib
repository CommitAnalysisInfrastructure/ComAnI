  abstract = {In contrast to traditional software systems, the evolution of a Software
	Product Line (SPL) affects not only artifacts like source code or
	requirements, but also variability information, which supports the
	customization of these artifacts across different products of the
	SPL. While some work exists that aims at characterizing the state
	and evolution of a product line from a feature perspective, this
	abstracts away the details of code evolution, hence, ignoring aspects
	like the difference in size of features. In this paper, we present
	an approach for the extraction and analysis of changes introduced
	to code, build and variability model artifacts. This approach has
	been developed for and applied to the Linux product line.},
