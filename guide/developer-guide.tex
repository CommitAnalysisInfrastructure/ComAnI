\section{Developer Guide}
\label{sec:DeveloperGuide}
Developers create their own plug-ins for the main infrastructure.
Hence, we describe the necessary information about such development in this section.
However, we focus on developing extractor plug-ins as they must implement different methods and, hence, capabilities.
The realization of an analysis plug-in is rather straightforward and shares methods with the extractors (explained there in detail).
Hence, we only outline a new analysis plug-in by a blueprint of the main commit analyzer class.
For both extractor and analysis plug-ins to be used with the main infrastructure, the respective projects must be exported as a simple Java archive file.
