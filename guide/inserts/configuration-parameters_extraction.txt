# The fully qualified main class name of the commit extractor
# to use in the particular ComAnI instance. Although being
# mandatory, the infrastructure will ignore this parameter, if
# reuse is enabled. 
#
# Type: mandatory
# Default value: none
# Related parameters: none
extraction.extractor = <Extractor>

# The path to the directory denoting the root of a software
# repository from which the commit extractor will extract the
# commits. Although being mandatory, extractors will ignore
# this parameter in interactive mode.
#
# Type: mandatory
# Default value: none
# Related parameters: none
extraction.input = <Path>

# The path to and name of the file containing a list of commit
# numbers. Extractors will try to extract the corresponding
# commits from the specified repository exclusively.
#
# Type: optional
# Default value: none
# Related parameters: none
extraction.commit_list = <Path>

# The path to the directory for saving extracted commits.
# Defining this parameter enables the caching feature for the
# extraction, which allows saving extracted commits as individual
# files and reuse them in future analyses, while the current
# analysis processes the extracted commits as usual. This avoids
# repeating the extraction of the same commits for future analyses.
#
# IMPORTANT: the infrastructure deletes the content of this
# directory, if it is not emtpy.
#
# Type: optional
# Default value: none
# Related parameters: extraction.reuse
extraction.cache = <Path>

# The path to the directory containing cached commits. Defining
# this parameter enables the caching feature for the extraction,
# which leads to a reuse of previously extracted commits instead of
# executing the defined extractor. This avoids repeating the
# extraction of the same commits for future analyses.
#
# IMPORTANT: if caching and reusing is defined at the same time,
# caching is performed and the analysis uses extracted commits.
#
# Type: optional
# Default value: none
# Related parameters: none
extraction.reuse = <Path>
