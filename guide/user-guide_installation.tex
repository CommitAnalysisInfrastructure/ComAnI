\subsection{Installation}
\label{sec:Installation}
This section describes the installation of the main infrastructure as well as how to satisfy its requirements. We provide this description for both operating systems currently used to execute \thetool{}: Ubuntu and Windows. However, the first part in Section~\ref{sec:Download} is operating system independent, while Section~\ref{sec:Requirements} contains descriptions for both operating systems.

\subsubsection{Downloading \thetool{}}
\label{sec:Download}
We recommend downloading the \fselement{\thetool{.zip}} archive, which already contains the main infrastructure, the guide, and the plug-ins developed by the SSE group. This requires the following steps, which are operating system independent:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go to \url{https://github.com/CommitAnalysisInfrastructure/ComAnI}
	\item Navigate to the release directory
	\item Click on the \fselement{\thetool{.zip}} file
	\item Click the Download button and save the archive
	\item Go to the download directory and extract all files in the \thetool{.zip} archive to your favorite directory
\end{enumerate}
The directory to which the \thetool{-plug-ins} are extracted in step 5 above is used for the definition of the configuration file in Section~\ref{sec:Execution}.

\subsubsection{Satisfying Requirements}
\label{sec:Requirements}
The execution of \thetool{} requires the installation of Java 11 or higher (or equivalents, like OpenJDK). The required steps for this installation are operating system dependent Hence, we first describe the necessary steps for Ubuntu and then for Windows below.

\textbf{On Ubuntu}, the following steps have to be performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open a Terminal
	\item Update the apt package index: \clcommand{sudo apt update}
	\item Install OpenJDK:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Either the default, if it is OpenJDK 11 or higher: \clcommand{sudo apt install default-jdk}
		\item Or explicitly OpenJDK 11: \clcommand{sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Check if the installation was successful by printing the installed Java version: \clcommand{java -version}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{On Windows}, the following steps have to be performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Distribution-dependent installation:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For Oracle Java:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Go to \url{https://www.java.com/en/download/} (Oracle Java)
			\item Download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for your system
			\item Execute the installer and follow its instructions
		\end{enumerate}
		\item For OpenJDK:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Go to \url{https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11}
			\item Download the RI Binary (build 11+28) Windows/x64 Java Development Kit
			\item Extract the content of that archive to your favorite location
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Check if the installation was successful by printing the installed Java version:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Open the Command Prompt: Hit the Windows-Key or click Start, type \clcommand{cmd} and hit Enter
		\item In the Command Prompt: \clcommand{java -version}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
